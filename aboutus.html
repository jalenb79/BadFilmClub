	Who are we?
Bad Film Club is a video production company with its own clothing line. Bad films need bad clothes to go with it, right? (Please note the irony)

How did you get the name "Bad Film Club"?
Short and simple, the name was an idea thrown out for an actual reality TV show series. No, there will not be a show (sadly).

What will come within the next ten years?
I plan to create my team. I need a crew who will live up to this name, and I will broaden what Bad Film Club will be. I want it to be more than a company, I want it to be a movement.
I am only seventeen, so, bluntly, I'm not too sure what I will make of this. But I know with time, it'll all piece together.
